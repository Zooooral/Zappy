# Game Rules and Mechanics

## Objective

Zappy is a survival and evolution game where teams of AI players compete to achieve the highest level of evolution. The first team to have 6 players reach level 8 wins the game.

## World Structure

### Map Layout
- **Shape**: Rectangular torus (edges wrap around)
- **Dimensions**: Configurable (minimum 6x6, maximum 50x50)
- **Tiles**: Each tile can contain players and resources

### Resource Types

| Resource | Symbol | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Food | üçé | Sustains player life |
| Linemate | üíé | Required for level 1-2 elevation |
| Deraumere | üîÆ | Required for level 2-3 elevation |
| Sibur | ‚ö™ | Required for level 3-4 elevation |
| Mendiane | üü° | Required for level 4-5 elevation |
| Phiras | üîµ | Required for level 5-6 elevation |
| Thystame | üü£ | Required for level 6-7 elevation |

### Resource Distribution
Resources spawn randomly across the map with different density rates:
- **Food**: 50% density (most common)
- **Linemate**: 30% density
- **Deraumere**: 15% density
- **Sibur**: 10% density
- **Mendiane**: 10% density
- **Phiras**: 8% density
- **Thystame**: 5% density (rarest)

## Player Mechanics

### Life System
- **Initial Life**: 10 food units (1260 time units of survival)
- **Food Consumption**: 1 food unit per 126 time units
- **Death**: Occurs when food reaches 0
- **Respawn**: New players can join if team slots available

### Movement and Orientation
- **Directions**: North (1), East (2), South (3), West (4)
- **Vision**: Limited to nearby tiles based on current level
- **Movement**: One tile per action in current facing direction

### Inventory Management
- **Capacity**: Unlimited resource storage
- **Actions**: Pick up and drop resources on current tile
- **Sharing**: Resources can be dropped for team members

## Level Advancement

### Elevation Requirements

| Level | Players | Linemate | Deraumere | Sibur | Mendiane | Phiras | Thystame |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| 1‚Üí2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2‚Üí3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3‚Üí4 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| 4‚Üí5 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 5‚Üí6 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| 6‚Üí7 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 7‚Üí8 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |

### Elevation Process
1. **Gathering**: Collect required players and resources on same tile
2. **Initiation**: Lead player starts incantation
3. **Duration**: Elevation takes 300 time units
4. **Interruption**: Other players can disrupt the process
5. **Success**: All participating players advance one level
