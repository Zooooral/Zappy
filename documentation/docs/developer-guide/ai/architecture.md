# AI Architecture

The AI module implements autonomous game clients using Node.js, providing rapid development capabilities and sophisticated strategy implementation.

## Core Components

### Strategy Engine
```javascript
class StrategyEngine {
    constructor(config) {
        this.goals = new GoalStack();
        this.worldMap = new WorldMap();
        this.communication = new TeamComm();
    }
    
    async executeStrategy() {
        const action = await this.decideNextAction();
        return await this.executeAction(action);
    }
}
```

### World Model
The AI maintains a mental model of the game world:
- **Map Representation**: Sparse grid with known tile contents
- **Resource Tracking**: Locations and availability of resources
- **Player Positions**: Known locations of team members and opponents
- **Temporal State**: Tracking of game timing and action queues

### Decision Making
```javascript
class DecisionTree {
    evaluate(gameState) {
        if (gameState.food < CRITICAL_FOOD) {
            return new FindFoodGoal();
        }
        
        if (this.canElevate(gameState)) {
            return new ElevationGoal();
        }
        
        return new ExploreGoal();
    }
}
```

## Strategy Implementation

### Goal-Based Architecture
- **Hierarchical Goals**: High-level objectives broken into actionable steps
- **Priority System**: Dynamic goal prioritization based on game state
- **Interrupt Handling**: Critical situations override current goals

### Pathfinding
- **A* Algorithm**: Efficient path calculation across the torus map
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Avoiding other players and dangerous areas
- **Multi-objective Paths**: Combining movement with resource collection

### Communication Protocol
- **Team Coordination**: Sharing resource locations and strategy updates
- **Message Encoding**: Efficient information packing for broadcasts
- **Noise Handling**: Filtering and interpreting team communications
